## Introduction
This project focuses on SQL database management using SSMS. It includes queries for creating and modifying database objects, such as tables, views, and constraints. The provided queries demonstrate various aspects of SQL, including table creation, data manipulation, and querying.

## Database Objects
The following database objects are used in the provided queries:

1. ProductMaster: This table stores information about products, including their ID and name.
2. CustomerTransaction: This table manages customer transactions, including customer details, credit card points, and product information.
3. UniqueKeyTable01: This table demonstrates the usage of primary keys and unique constraints.
4. LOCATION: This table represents different locations with their IDs and city names.
5. DEPARTMENT: This table stores department details, including department IDs, names, and location IDs.
6. JOB: This table holds job information, such as job IDs and designations.
7. Employee: This table contains employee details, including their job IDs, department IDs, and other relevant information.

## Queries and Examples
The project provides various SQL queries and examples to illustrate different database management scenarios. These queries cover topics such as creating tables, altering table structures, managing constraints, and performing data retrieval.

Constraints
The project utilizes SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) to apply various constraints on the database tables. Constraints such as primary keys, foreign keys, unique keys, and check constraints were implemented to ensure data integrity and enforce business rules. SSMS provided a user-friendly interface to design, create, and manage these constraints, allowing for efficient database management.

Please note that the provided queries are intended for demonstration purposes only and should not be manipulated directly. Modify the queries as needed for your specific database environment.

The queries are organized based on different topics and can be executed in SSMS or any SQL Server-compatible environment.

Feel free to explore and utilize these queries as a reference for your own SQL database management tasks.
